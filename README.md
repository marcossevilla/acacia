# Project Acacia

A Flutter project for National Herbarium.

## This is important, read it

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://flutter.dev/docs/cookbook)

For help getting started with Flutter, view our
[online documentation](https://flutter.dev/docs), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.

## Set up the project

After making `git clone` you need to set up all the dependencies of the project.

**If you're using Android Studio, you need the IDE to recognize it's a Flutter project and not an Android one.**

Personal recommendation: **Use VSCode**.

Run `flutter packages get` in the terminal while you're in the project's folder.

That should be it.
